# Yojimbot Project

Yojimbot is a comics in the first place which I LOVE. I decided to make a project based on this. (no commercial purpose)

For now I do have:

- Control rig to replace foot
- Combat system
- [WIP] anim blueprint with layers
- Dummy AI
- AI Task making AI head target player if in range
- Cutting object using the Unreal Component
- Attack system with new Input system
- Hit system that play hit animation base on attack angle
